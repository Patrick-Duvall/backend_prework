## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
To put aside a chunk of code into a reusable part. In my mind it's like a variable for a section of code.
1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

end
```
1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
